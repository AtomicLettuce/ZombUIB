#ZombUIB is a VR web based shooter game heavily inspired by Call of Duty: Black
Ops - Zombies where the player faces zombie hordes hoping to survive for as
long as possible.

To develop this web-app A-Frame has been used to build the VR scene, node.js to
build the server side and MySQL for the database (which is used to keep track
of the leaderboards).

This project served as a final degree project in Computer Engineering for
Xavier Vives Marcus at the UIB (University of the Balearic Islands) for more
info. check out memoria.pdf.
